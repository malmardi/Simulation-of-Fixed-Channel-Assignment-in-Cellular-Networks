# Simulation-of-Fixed-Channel-Assignment-in-Cellular-Networks

**Description:**
This project was implemented in the wireless communications course in Fall/2011 at the American University of Sharjah (AUS).

**Simulation measurements:**

 - There is “N” number of full-duplex channels available in a given cell
   in the cellular network.
 - At a given time, up to (and including) N different voice calls
   (users) can be serviced by the system and the (N+1) the call (user)
   will be rejected (blocked).
 - Calls arrival is Poisson process.
 - Service time (call duration) is exponential distribution.
 - Simulation time:  3000
 - Arrival rate: varies between (0.1-14.5). It is common for all users
   in the system.
 - Service rate: 1

**Language used:** C++

**Repository Structure:**

 - Report: includes a description of the simulation requireements and results.
 - Excel sheets: include the results
